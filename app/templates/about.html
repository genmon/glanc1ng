<h1>About</h1>

<h3>What happens?</h3>

<p>Use Glanc1ng to let your Twitter friends know that someone is thinking about them. After you sign in, you'll see a "Glance" button: Hit that and when any of your friends visits this site, they'll see your name for 24 hours (only if you follow them on Twitter and they follow you). If they don't follow you, it's anonymous. They won't see your name.</p>

<p>You can also make a group of people to pay special attention to. Your group can be close friends, coworkers, or maybe just a loved one -- a group of one. When one of your group glances, you can see that for longer than the 24 hour limit. And then you can glance back. And so on, back and forth.</p>

<h3>Is that it?</h3>

<p>Yes. Sorta. Kinda. It's minimal. Glanc1ng is a work in progress, and there's more to come...</p>

<p>Glanc1ng is a teeny weeny experiment in small group dynamics, and working with the smallest - almost ambiguous - possible unit of interaction: Eye contact. Can we use glancing (or Glanc1ng) to strengthen existing social relationships? To choose when to have lunch together, without overt planning? For togetherness? To build intimacy in the crowded social networks, and warmth in the individual isolation of the inbox? Dunno. Let's see what happens, and I'll build more features as they occur to me.</p>

<h3>A teeny weeny experiment?</h3>

<p>Glanc1ng should be considered "pre-pre-alpha." There's been no effort put into site scaling, and the database isn't being backed up.</p>

<h3>What is a glance?</h3>

<p>A glance is...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pleasant: It's nice to discover that two of you have glanced at one-another recently.</li>
	<li>Reciprocal: The only way to see whether someone has glanced at you is to glance at them.</li>
	<li>Polite by default: You won't notice glances from a person unless you've actively add them to your group. And if you add a person, they won't be prompted to add you back.</li>
</ul>

<h3>How come the Twitter thing?</h3>

<p>Twitter provides sign-in and an underlying social network. It's easier than building these things just for this. Glanc1ng doesn't read your tweets, and won't tweet on your behalf. Glanc1ng <em>does</em> look at your friends list, and sends glances to them within the Glanc1ng system -- note that your friends will only notice you glancing if they have already actively added you to their group, and if you're mutual friends on Twitter. If a friend hasn't added you to their group, they will only see that they have received an anonymous glance.</p>

<h3>What's the history?</h3>

<p>I'm Matt Webb. You can find me at <a href="https://twitter.com/genmon">@genmon</a>. Way back in 2003/4, I wrote the very first version of this software and <a href="http://glancing.interconnected.org/2004/02/etcon/">gave a talk about it</a> (<a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/2003/09/glancing/">more notes</a>). This re-imagination - and first public version - is for me to celebrate 10 years since that talk at the O'Reilly Emerging Technology Conference on 11 February 2004. Timequake! Also so I can remember how to code. It's been a while.</p>
