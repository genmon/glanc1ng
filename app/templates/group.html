<h1>Edit group</h1>

<p>Pay special attention to these people. Instead of just seeing if they've glanced in the last 24 hours, you'll see exactly when they were active.</p>

<p>And if all of them have been active on Glanc1ng inside the last 60 minutes, you'll be able to one-click* start a conversation with them on Twitter.</p>

<p><em>*okay, it's more like two clicks right now.</em></p>

<p>Group members are chosen from your "mutual followers" on Twitter (people  you follow, who you follow back).</p>

<table class="table">
	{% for group_member in lookin_at %}

			<td>{{ group_member.looking_at_twitter_display_name|safe }}</td>
			<td>
			<form method="POST" action="{{ url_for('group_member_remove', member=group_member.looking_at_twitter_display_name[1:]) }}">
				{{ remove_form.hidden_tag() }}
				<input type="submit" value="Remove">
