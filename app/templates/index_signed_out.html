<h3>What is Glanc1ng?</h3>

<p>Glanc1ng helps you sync up with your closest friends, workmates, or significant other. Use Glanc1ng to see when your very closest Twitter friends are active -- if all of them are active, start a conversation. (You'll also get to see when "mutual followers" on Twitter use Glanc1ng - the people you follow who also follow you - and they'll see you.)</p>

<p>When you glance at a friend, you're letting them know you're thinking about them. When your friend glances back, you know they're thinking about you too.</p>

<p>Glanc1ng does not read your tweets, and will not tweet on your behalf. Glanc1ng <em>does</em> use Twitter for sign in, and for your list of friends so that your activity is visible to mutual followers.</p>

<h3>Is that it?</h3>

<p>Yes. Sorta. Kinda. It's minimal. Glanc1ng is a work in progress, and there's more to come. <strong><a href="{{ url_for("about") }}">Learn more!</a></strong></p>
